        //17  16  15  14  13
        //18   5   4   3  12
        //19   6   1   2  11
        //20   7   8   9  10
        //21  22  23---> ...
        //While this is very space-efficient (no squares are skipped), requested data must be carried back to square 1 (the location of the only access port for this memory system) by programs that can only move up, down, left, or right.They always take the shortest path: the Manhattan Distance between the location of the data and square 1.

        //For example:

        //Data from square 1 is carried 0 steps, since it's at the access port.
        //Data from square 12 is carried 3 steps, such as: down, left, left.
        //Data from square 23 is carried only 2 steps: up twice.
        //Data from square 1024 must be carried 31 steps.
        //How many steps are required to carry the data from the square identified in your puzzle input all the way to the access port?
